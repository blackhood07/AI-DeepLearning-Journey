# Day 5: Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) ðŸ“·

CNNs are designed to process data in the form of multiple arrays, such as color images composed of three 2D arrays (height, width, color channels).

## Key Concepts:
- Convolutional Layers
- Filters/Kernels
- Max Pooling
- Flattening and Fully Connected Layers

## Why CNNs?
- Capture spatial hierarchies in images
- Automatically learn features
- Extremely efficient for image classification tasks

## Todayâ€™s Hands-on:
We will implement a basic CNN on the MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits.
