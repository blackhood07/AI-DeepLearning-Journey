# Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data.

## Key Concepts:
- **Features (X):** Input variables
- **Labels (y):** Target output
- **Goal:** Learn a function that maps inputs to outputs

## Common Algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)

## Applications:
- Email spam detection
- Disease diagnosis
- Stock price prediction
- Sentiment analysis
