# Introduction to Neural Networks ðŸ§ 

Neural Networks are at the heart of modern AI and Deep Learning!

## Key Concepts:
- Artificial Neurons
- Activation Functions (ReLU, Sigmoid)
- Layers: Input, Hidden, Output
- Forward Propagation
- Loss & Optimization

## Why Neural Nets?
- They learn hierarchical features
- Great for image, text, and speech tasks

## Todayâ€™s Hands-on:
We'll build a simple Neural Network using `Keras` to classify digits from the famous MNIST dataset.
