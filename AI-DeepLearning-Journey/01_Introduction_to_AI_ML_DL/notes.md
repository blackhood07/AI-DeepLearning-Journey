# Introduction to AI, ML, and Deep Learning

## What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think and learn.

## What is Machine Learning (ML)?
ML is a subset of AI that enables machines to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

## What is Deep Learning (DL)?
DL is a specialized area of ML using neural networks with multiple layers to model complex patterns in data.

## Real-World Applications
- Self-driving cars
- Voice assistants
- Recommendation systems
- Medical diagnosis
