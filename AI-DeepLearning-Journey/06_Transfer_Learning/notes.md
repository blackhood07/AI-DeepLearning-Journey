# Day 6: Transfer Learning with CNNs ðŸš€

Transfer learning leverages pre-trained models on new tasks. Today we explored:
- Feature extraction and fine-tuning
- Using VGG16 for image classification
- Benefits: faster training, better performance with less data

## Use Case:
We classified a small dataset using the pre-trained VGG16 model (without retraining the entire network).

## Libraries:
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib
