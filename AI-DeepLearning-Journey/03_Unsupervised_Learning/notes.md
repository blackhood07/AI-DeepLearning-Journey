# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning involves learning patterns from data without labeled responses.

## Key Concepts:
- **No target labels (y)**
- **Goal:** Discover hidden structure or patterns

## Common Algorithms:
- Clustering (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN)
- Dimensionality Reduction (e.g., PCA, t-SNE)

## Applications:
- Customer segmentation
- Anomaly detection
- Market basket analysis
